### Like a newtab, but with more stuff
## Setup
#### 1. Fork
To setup you need to first fork this repo(A star is also helpful)

#### 2. Run

## Todo
- [x] Add a settings menu

- [ ] Alternative search engines, currently it's all DuckDuckGo
- [partial] Allow custom wallpapers and themes
- [ ] Add more widgets and make them customizable
- [ ] Introducing a feature to change apps on the bottom bar
